1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
this case RTO is the time to complete the switch to a different AZ. Minimum 100-120 seconds.
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
In this case RTO timing requires starting up a new Amazon RDS instance and then applying all
changes since the last backup. 45 mins to 1 hour.
Manual intervention.
- Steps:
    1. Use existing replica and promote function.
    2. Reconfigure the application to point to new DB which is choosen replica.
3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: RPO is 0
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
If we set up an RDS database with automatic backups enabled, the RPO will be based on how often data is backed up. If we set up a backup every 4 hours, the minimun RPO will be 4 - 6 hours.
